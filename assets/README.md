# Logo Installation Instructions

## To add the official Ayres Associates logo:

1. **Save the logo image** you provided as `ayres-logo.png` in the `assets/` folder
2. **Recommended dimensions**: 120px wide x 40px tall (or maintain aspect ratio)
3. **File format**: PNG with transparent background preferred
4. **Alternative**: You can also use SVG format and rename to `ayres-logo.svg`

## Current Implementation

The HTML is already configured to use:
```html
<img src="assets/ayres-logo.png" alt="Ayres Associates" class="logo">
```

With a fallback placeholder if the file isn't found.

## Brand Colors Updated

I've updated the color scheme to match the Ayres Associates brand:
- **Primary Blue**: #1B4F8E (from your logo)
- **Secondary Blue**: #2E6BB0
- **Accent Blue**: #4A90E2

These colors are now used throughout:
- Header gradient
- Project color coding
- Interactive elements
- Buttons and controls

## Testing

Once you add the logo file, refresh the application to see:
- Official Ayres logo in the header
- Updated brand colors throughout the interface
- Professional appearance matching company branding

# WROC Project Tracker - Mockup Summary

## Project Overview
The WROC Project Tracker is a fully functional web-based prototype that visualizes 15 years of Wisconsin aerial mapping projects through an interactive map interface. This tool serves the Wisconsin Regional Orthoimagery Consortium (WROC) and Ayres Associates by providing spatial project management capabilities for orthoimagery and LiDAR collections across all 72 Wisconsin counties.

## How to Interact with the Prototype
**Access**: Live prototype available at: https://darnouk.github.io/WROC-Project-Tracker/  
**Login**: Click "Login" â†’ Select "Temporary Demo Admin Access"  
**Navigation**: Use left sidebar filters + interactive map with authentic Wisconsin county boundaries

### Key Interactive Features:
- **Multi-select Filtering**: Hold Ctrl+Click to select multiple project types and counties
- **Dynamic Map Updates**: Counties highlight/dim based on filter selections  
- **County Information**: Click any county boundary for project details popup
- **Real-time Results**: Filter statistics update instantly in right sidebar
- **Clear Reset**: "Clear All" button returns interface to default state

## Feedback Requested
This prototype represents the "look and feel" of the final WROC Project Tracker. Please focus your feedback on:

### 1. **User Interface & Visual Design**
- Does the interface feel intuitive for GIS project managers?
- Are the Wisconsin county boundaries clearly visible and appropriately styled?
- Is the WROC branding and color scheme professional and appropriate?

### 2. **Functionality & Workflow**
- How easy is it to complete realistic project management tasks?
- Are the filtering options (Project Type: Ortho/LiDAR, Year Range, County Selection) sufficient?
- Does the multi-select functionality with Ctrl+Click feel natural?

### 3. **Information Architecture**
- Is the three-panel layout (filters, map, results) logical and efficient?
- Do the county popups display the right information for project tracking?
- Are the filter results and statistics meaningful and helpful?

### 4. **Technical Performance**
- Does the map respond smoothly to panning, zooming, and filtering?
- Are loading times acceptable for a production environment?
- Do all interactive elements (buttons, dropdowns, popups) work as expected?

### 5. **Real-World Application**
- Could you envision using this tool for actual aerial mapping project management?
- What additional features or modifications would enhance practical usability?
- Does this prototype effectively address the needs described in our user scenario?

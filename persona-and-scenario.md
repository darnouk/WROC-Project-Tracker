# WROC Project Tracker - Persona and Scenario

## User Persona: Zach N., Aerial Mapping Group Manager

**Background**: Zach is a middle-aged senior manager of the aerial mapping group at Ayres Associates. He has decades of experience in geospatial project coordination and manages multiple aerial mapping initiatives across Wisconsin counties simultaneously.

**Role & Responsibilities**: 
- Oversees dozens of active orthoimagery and LiDAR projects annually.
- Supervises an aerial mapping team of 30 total project managers, supervisors, and technicians.
- Coordinates with county governments, contractors, and state agencies on project scope, budgeting, and contracting.
- Tracks project timelines, budgets, and deliverable specifications.
- Reports progress to WROC leadership committee and stakeholders.

**Pain Points**:
- Currently uses spreadsheets and static maps to track 30+ years of historical projects.
- Difficult to quickly visualize project coverage gaps across Wisconsin.
- Time-intensive to answer stakeholder questions about project history.
- Challenging to identify counties ready for new orthoimagery cycles. Mostly reliant on dated static maps and memory.

**Technical Comfort**: Intermediate GIS user, comfortable with web applications, prefers intuitive and aesthetic interfaces over complex software.

## Scenario of Envisioned Use

### Morning Planning Session
It's Tuesday morning, and Zach receives an email from the WROC leadership committee asking: *"After hearing about the 2023-2025 cycle's tremendous success in delivering orthoimagery at various high resolutions, Douglas County's LIO has expressed interest in joining our consortium. They would like further insight on Ayres' experience delivering specifically 6" resolution throughout the last 5 years. Can you provide a list of counties this has been done for since 2020?"*

Instead of opening multiple spreadsheets and cross-referencing project databases, Zach opens the WROC Project Tracker on his laptop.

### Step 1: Quick Assessment
Zach logs in and immediately sees Wisconsin's county boundaries displayed on an interactive map. He can quickly scan the visual landscape and see the current state of project coverage across the state.

### Step 2: Targeted Analysis
He sets the filters to:
- **Project Type**: Ortho only
- **Year Range**: 2020-2025 (last 5 years)
- **Location**: <no filters set; want all counties>
- **Resolution**: 6"

After clicking "Apply Filters," the map updates to highlight only counties with recent Orthoimagery projects while dimming others. Zach can instantly see which counties had 6" Ortho projects in the last 5 years under "Total Projects" and convey that information to WROC/Douglas County.


### Step 3: Stakeholder Communication
Within 15 minutes, Zach has compiled a comprehensive response for the WROC leadership committee.

## Meaningful Insight Achievement

Through this scenario, Zach transforms from reactive data hunting to proactive spatial analysis. The WROC Project Tracker enables him to:


1. **Respond Rapidly**: Answer complex stakeholder questions in minutes instead of hours
4. **Communicate Effectively**: Provide visual evidence to support project recommendations
5. **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Identify clustering opportunities for cost-effective project bundling

The tool transforms Sarah's role from data manager to strategic advisor, enabling WROC to make informed decisions about Wisconsin's aerial mapping future while maintaining accountability for the consortium's 30-year investment in statewide geospatial infrastructure.

# WROC Project Tracker - Persona and Scenario

## User Persona: Sarah Chen, GIS Project Manager

**Background**: Sarah is a 32-year-old GIS Project Manager at the Wisconsin Regional Orthoimagery Consortium (WROC). She has 8 years of experience in geospatial project coordination and manages multiple aerial mapping initiatives across Wisconsin counties simultaneously.

**Role & Responsibilities**: 
- Oversees 15-20 active orthoimagery and LiDAR projects annually
- Coordinates with county governments, contractors, and state agencies
- Tracks project timelines, budgets, and deliverable specifications
- Reports progress to WROC steering committee and stakeholders

**Pain Points**:
- Currently uses spreadsheets and static maps to track 30+ years of historical projects
- Difficult to quickly visualize project coverage gaps across Wisconsin
- Time-intensive to answer stakeholder questions about project history
- Challenging to identify counties ready for new orthoimagery cycles

**Technical Comfort**: Intermediate GIS user, comfortable with web applications, prefers intuitive interfaces over complex software.

## Scenario of Envisioned Use

### Morning Planning Session
It's Tuesday morning, and Sarah receives an email from the WROC steering committee asking: *"Which counties haven't had LiDAR collection in the past 5 years, and what would be the estimated budget for a statewide update?"*

Instead of opening multiple spreadsheets and cross-referencing project databases, Sarah opens the WROC Project Tracker on her laptop.

### Step 1: Quick Assessment
Sarah logs in and immediately sees Wisconsin's county boundaries displayed on an interactive map. She can quickly scan the visual landscape and see the current state of project coverage across the state.

### Step 2: Targeted Analysis
She sets the filters to:
- **Project Type**: LiDAR only
- **Year Range**: 2019-2024 (last 5 years)
- **Location**: Statewide

After clicking "Apply Filters," the map updates to highlight only counties with recent LiDAR projects while dimming others. Sarah can instantly see visual gaps - counties that appear dimmed are candidates for new LiDAR collection.

### Step 3: Detailed Investigation
Sarah clicks on several dimmed counties (those without recent LiDAR) to view their popup information. Each popup shows:
- County name
- Last LiDAR collection year (if any)
- Resolution specifications from previous collections

### Step 4: Documentation and Planning
Using the visual map and results panel showing project counts, Sarah quickly identifies 23 counties needing LiDAR updates. She takes a screenshot of the filtered map view and notes the budget totals from the results section.

### Step 5: Stakeholder Communication
Within 15 minutes, Sarah has compiled a comprehensive response for the steering committee, including a visual map showing gaps, specific county lists, and preliminary budget estimates based on historical project data.

## Meaningful Insight Achievement

Through this scenario, Sarah transforms from reactive data hunting to proactive spatial analysis. The WROC Project Tracker enables her to:

1. **Visualize Coverage Gaps**: Instantly identify counties needing attention through map-based filtering
2. **Make Data-Driven Decisions**: Use historical patterns to inform future project planning
3. **Respond Rapidly**: Answer complex stakeholder questions in minutes instead of hours
4. **Communicate Effectively**: Provide visual evidence to support project recommendations
5. **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Identify clustering opportunities for cost-effective project bundling

The tool transforms Sarah's role from data manager to strategic advisor, enabling WROC to make informed decisions about Wisconsin's aerial mapping future while maintaining accountability for the consortium's 30-year investment in statewide geospatial infrastructure.
